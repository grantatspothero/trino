        -p    Project to build (data-server|discovery-server)
        -r    Docker repository
        -v    Project version
        -a    Platform types for multi-arch build
```

./bin/build-docker-image.sh -p data-server -r example.repo.com/some_repo -v data-server-999-vg4ws65

For local development it may be used as follows

## Keep pom.xml clean and sorted

There are several plugins in place to keep pom.xml clean.
Your build may fail if:
 - dependencies or XML elements are not ordered correctly
 - overall pom.xml structure is not correct

Many such errors may be fixed automatically by running the following:
`./mvnw sortpom:sort`
